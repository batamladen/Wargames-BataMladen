# Wargames BataMladen ðŸš©

**Wargames BataMladen** is an interactive, challenge-based platform for learning and practicing Linux fundamentals and ethical hacking skills through a game-like environment.

Each **challenge** focuses on a specific topic â€” such as file permissions, network services, reverse engineering, or privilege escalation â€” and is divided into multiple **progressive levels** that increase in difficulty.

Players connect via SSH to isolated container environments hosted on a private server. To advance, they must solve each level and retrieve a hidden **flag**, which contains the **SSH password for the next challenge**. This chained structure reinforces practical skill development and simulates real-world attack paths.

The platform is Open-Source-ish. The Frontend is fully available here on GitHub while the Backend is hosted on a private server, 
because if we make the backend available at GitHub as well, people can just look at how the challenges are structured in the DockerImages and finish them easier.


But... Everyone loves Pull Requests. And we accept contibutions to the "Academy" section.
We need help with writing lessons for the academy modules.
Look at the Issues marked "Help Needed" to see where help is needed in the academy.

For more substantial changes, open an issue to ensure we're on the same page. Together, we make this project better for all! âœ¨

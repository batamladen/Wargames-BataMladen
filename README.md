# Wargames BataMladen ðŸš©

**Wargames BataMladen** is an interactive, challenge-based platform for learning and practicing Linux fundamentals and ethical hacking skills through a game-like environment.

Each **challenge** focuses on a specific topic â€” such as file permissions, network services, reverse engineering, or privilege escalation â€” and is divided into multiple **progressive levels** that increase in difficulty.

Players connect via SSH to isolated container environments hosted on a remote server. To advance, they must solve each level and retrieve a hidden **flag**, which contains the **SSH password for the next challenge**. This chained structure reinforces practical skill development and simulates real-world attack paths.
